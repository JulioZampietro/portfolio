### Projects
**1. Power BI and gym data (learning project)**

Utilizing Microsoft Power BI, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bodyweight and workout data spanning a seven-year period (2016-2023). The project culminated in the creation of a suite of annual dashboards, each providing a focused analysis of a specific year's data. Additionally, a consolidated dashboard was developed, offering a holistic view of all the analyzed data.

**Key takeaways**
- a) Use of colors to highlight certain information, such as workout frequency throughout the years.
- b) Graph choice when dealing with different kinds of information, particulary when choosing a pie chart only to represent binary information.
- c) Certain kinds of data (such as bodyweight) give little information when taken in the aggregate, while others (such as workout frequency) can show patterns even when considering the holistic approach.
