## Projects
### 1. Power BI and gym data (learning project)

Utilizing Microsoft Power BI, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bodyweight and workout data spanning a seven-year period (2016-2023). The project culminated in the creation of a suite of annual dashboards, each providing a focused analysis of a specific year's data. Additionally, a consolidated dashboard was developed, offering a holistic view of all the analyzed data.

**Key takeaways**
- a) Graph choice adequate to different kinds of information (bar chart for categorical data, pie chart for binary information, line chart to visualize change over time).
- b) Use of colors to highlight certain information (e.g. workout frequency throughout the years).
- c) A holistic approach is more useful when dealing with certain kinds of data (e.g. workout frequency), while providing less insight with other kinds (e.g. bodyweight).
