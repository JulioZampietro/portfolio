## Projects
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis: 2021 Tokyo Olympics total medals ([Repository](https://github.com/JulioZampietro/2021-Olympics-EDA))

**Skills:** SQL / Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) / Statistics / Storytelling

Through SQL, Python and statistical knowledge I conducted an EDA on Olympic data from 2021 with the following conclusions:

- There is a strong correlation between total medals, total GDP (0.831), competing athletes (0.875), and total sports spending (0.817), while per capita measures had weak correlations (less than 0.3).

- Countries that sent more than average athletes from collective sports greatly outperformed those focused primarily on individual sports.

- The conclusions suggest that a path forward is for countries to increase sports spending across the board, contrary to focusing on individual categories that provide a greater medal-opportunity-per-athlete ratio.

### 2. Power BI and gym data (learning project)

**Skills:** Power BI / Storytelling

Utilizing Microsoft Power BI, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bodyweight and workout data spanning a seven-year period (2016-2023). The project culminated in the creation of a suite of annual dashboards, each providing a focused analysis of a specific year's data. Additionally, a consolidated dashboard was developed, offering a holistic view of all the analyzed data.

**Key takeaways**
- a) Graph choice adequate to different kinds of information (bar chart for categorical data, pie chart for binary information, line chart to visualize change over time).
- b) Use of colors to highlight certain information (e.g. workout frequency throughout the years).
- c) A holistic approach is more useful when dealing with certain kinds of data (e.g. workout frequency), while providing less insight with other kinds (e.g. bodyweight).
