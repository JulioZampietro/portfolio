### Projects
**1. Power BI and gym data**
Learning project in which I used Microsoft Power BI and storytelling principles to analyze and display personal bodyweight and workout data from 2016 through to 2023. The result was a series of annual dashboards and a single consolidated dashboard which summarized all information.

Image 1 (consolidated) besides image 2 (one annual dashboard)

Key takeaways from the project:
a) Use of colors to highlight certain information
b) Graph choice when dealing with different kinds of information
c) Certain kinds of data (such as bodyweight) give little information when taken in the aggregate, while others (such as workout frequency) can show patterns even when considering the consolidated data
